    "[FastCGI](http://www.mit.edu/~yandros/doc/specs/fcgi-spec.html) is a way for front-end servers to talk to back-end workers in a (somewhat) efficient and (somewhat) simple way. Although it's been around since 1996, it is not very widely appreciated, except in the PHP community, where it is very commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be a great approach for hosting Python scripts, avoiding the overhead of creating a new Python process for every request (as standard CGI would otherwise require) and without requiring large dependencies, complex C projects, or fiddly deployments. `fastcgi` has no dependencies other than [fastcore](https://fastcore.fast.ai/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no new frameworks or concepts to learn. Just call `send` to send anything you like back to the client, read the parameters from `params`, and the input from the client from `stdin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`fastcgi` requires a front-end web server. If you don't already have one set up, we recommend [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/). To forward all requests to `example.com` to a `fastcgi` server listening on port 1234 create a file called `Caddyfile` with the following contents, and then `caddy run`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    example.com\n",
    "    reverse_proxy localhost:1234 { transport fastcgi }\n",
    "\n",
    "This library also provides an HTTP handler that can be used in an identical way, except remove `{ transport fastcgi }` from the above `Caddyfile` example. Python's standard library already includes an HTTP handler (in `http.server`), however the documentation warns that that module should not be used in production code. The HTTP handler provided here is trimmed down to a minimal implementation (just 40 lines of code) so that it can easily be studied and extended. It uses the same basic API as Python's other `socketserver` classes (and the same as `FcgiHandler` here) so there's fewer new concepts to understand."
